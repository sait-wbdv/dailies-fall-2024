            Explanation:
            Sticky Header:
            
            The position: sticky property on the .sticky-header keeps the header at the top of the viewport when the user scrolls past it. The top: 0 ensures it sticks to the top of the page.
            A box-shadow is added for better visibility when the header becomes sticky.
            Fixed Sidebar:
            
            The .sidebar uses position: fixed to remain fixed on the left side of the viewport as the user scrolls. This keeps the sidebar always visible.
            The height of the sidebar is set to 100% to cover the full height of the page.
            Padding at the top ensures the content within the sidebar isn't hidden behind the header.
            Main Content:
            
            The .content section has a margin-left: 220px to leave space for the fixed sidebar. This prevents the content from being overlapped by the sidebar.
            How It Works:
            Fixed Sidebar: As you scroll the page, the sidebar stays fixed on the left side. This is useful for navigation menus that should always be accessible.
            Sticky Header: The header stays at the top of the page and sticks there after you scroll down past it, ensuring the page's title or navigation remains visible.
            You can add more content to the <main> section to simulate a longer page and fully see the effect of the sticky header and fixed sidebar.        </div>
