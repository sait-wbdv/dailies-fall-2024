Explanation:
HTML Structure:

Each card is wrapped inside a div with the class card, which contains an image (<img>) and a text block (<div class="card-text">).
The card title (<h3>) and description (<p>) are inside the card-text div.
CSS:

Card Layout: The .card-container uses display: flex to position the cards next to each other horizontally. Each card has a set width of 300px, and the image takes up the full width of the card.
Relative Positioning: The .card itself is positioned relatively using position: relative to create a reference point for the absolutely positioned text.
Text Overlay: The .card-text is absolutely positioned (position: absolute) within the .card, placing it at the bottom of the card (bottom: 10px) with padding and a semi-transparent background (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)) to make the text readable over the image.
How It Works:
Image: The image fills the card using width: 100%, making it responsive within the card container.
Relative and Absolute Positioning: The .card is relatively positioned, which serves as the reference for positioning the .card-text absolutely. This allows the text to be placed over the image and positioned at the bottom left.
Overlay Styling: The semi-transparent background of the text block ensures the text is readable without completely obscuring the image.
Customization:
You can easily change the number of cards, image sources, or text content.
Adjust the bottom, left, and right properties to move the text overlay to different positions on the image.
Change the background color or transparency to suit your design.
