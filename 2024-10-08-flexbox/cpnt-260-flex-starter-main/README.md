### <b> Team 1: Complex Header and Footer Layout</b>

- Create a layout with a header containing a logo on the left, navigation in the center, and a search bar on the right.
- The main content should have a two-column layout (sidebar and main content).
- The footer should have three sections: contact info, social media links, and a newsletter signup.

### <b>Team 2: Advanced Two-Column Layout</b>

- Create a layout with a fixed-width sidebar on the left and flexible main content on the right.
- Add a nested Flexbox inside the main content to create a two-row layout: a header and a content area that scrolls if the content is too long.

### <b>Team 3: Centered Content with Overlays</b>

- Create a layout where a box is centered both vertically and horizontally within the viewport.
- Add two overlay elements: a title at the top center of the box and a button at the bottom center of the box.

### <b>Team 4: Responsive Navigation Bar with Dropdowns</b>

- Create a horizontal navigation bar with evenly spaced items.
- Each navigation item should have a dropdown menu that appears on hover.
- Ensure the navigation bar is responsive and transforms into a vertical menu on smaller screens.

### <b> Team 5: Advanced Photo Gallery Layout</b>

- Create a responsive photo gallery with images arranged in a grid.
- Add a hover effect to each image that displays a title and description overlay.

### <b>Team 6: Equal Height Columns with Flexbox</b>

- Create a layout with three columns of equal height, regardless of the content inside.
- Add a nested Flexbox inside each column to create a header, content, and footer within each column.

### <b>Team 7: Interactive Pricing Table Layout</b>

- Create a responsive pricing table with three columns, each representing a different pricing plan.
- Add a feature list to each pricing plan.
- Highlight the most popular plan with a different background color and add a hover effect to enlarge the selected plan slightly.

### <b>Team 8: Feature Boxes with Animations</b>

- Create a layout with four feature boxes arranged in a two-by-two grid.
- Each feature box should have a fixed size and include a title, icon, and description.
- Add animations so that when a box is hovered over, it enlarges and displays the description with a fade-in effect.
